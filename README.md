# WebGallery
Simple web application with authorization mechanisms, possibility to add photo with public or private access and browse public phoyos added by others users.

Need to put jquery-ui and jquery-ui-themes to src/web/static/Scripts/ to proper work of app. Will be fixed in future to get jQuery from cdn.
